An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Ex: "Hello" and "holle"

Write a program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

RULES: 

1) The strings are considered anagrams if:
	They have the same characters in the same frequency, ignoring the order.
	Case sensitivity and spaces are ignored. For example:
	- "Listen" and "Silent" are anagrams.
	- "The eyes" and "They see" are anagrams.

2) If the strings are anagrams, print "Yes, they are anagrams!".
3) If not, print "No, they are not anagrams.".
