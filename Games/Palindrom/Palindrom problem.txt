Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Ex: "madam", "racecar", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama".

- Ignore case sensitivity, spaces, and special characters.
- Return a boolean (true or false) indicating whether the input string is a palindrome.
