Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100.

- The player has to guess the number by entering guesses.
- After each guess, the program should tell the player whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- The program should continue asking for guesses until the player guesses correctly.
Once the player guesses the number, the program should tell them how many attempts it took to guess the correct number.
