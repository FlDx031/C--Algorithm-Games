Hello and welcome, 

Let me explain the structure of this game.

For each file, you have a .txt file with instructions and a .cs file with the solution. 

It's important to know that there's no single way to solve the problem. Do your best to optimize complexity. If you think there's a better way of solving the problem, try it! 

Good luck!
